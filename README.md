# Computational Chemistry Script Archive (2023)

This repository contains Python scripts I wrote during my high school research project: *["Using Computational Chemistry to Explore the Asymmetric Synthesis of Fully Substituted Pyrrolidone"](https://twsf.ntsec.gov.tw/tisf/2024/pdf/TISF2024-030005.pdf)*.

## Purpose
These scripts were used to parse Gaussian output logs (`.log`) and extract energy data automatically.

## Status: Archived
> **Note:** This is a legacy codebase uploaded for demonstration purposes. The scripts were tailored to a specific file structure used during the research and may not run out-of-the-box in a new environment.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- File I/O (Log parsing)
- Data Processing
